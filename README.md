# Astranyx

A 2D video game project that will 100% never ever ever be even remotely closo
to finished. *EVER*.

## TODO

- [ ] Windowing system
  - [ ] Linux support
    - [ ] Wayland
      - [X] Creating a window
      - [ ] Support `xdg-decoration`
  - [ ] Windows support (haha)
- [ ] Vulkan rendering
  - [ ] Look into the "2" version of some api stuff
- [ ] ECS
- [ ] Asset loading
- [ ] UI system

Once Gnome will actually support `xdg-decoration` I will look at supporting it
again. Until then I'll just complain about how terrible it is for them to not
support SSD. Idiots...

## Why not C?

I dont like the C build system.
