## TODO

- [ ] Windowing system
  - [ ] Linux support
    - [ ] Wayland
      - [X] Creating a window
      - [ ] Support `xdg-decoration`
    - [ ] Xorg
  - [ ] Windows support
- [ ] Vulkan rendering
- [ ] CMS
- [ ] Finishing TODO

Once Gnome will actually support `xdg-decoration` I will look at supporting it
again. Until then I'll just complain about how terrible it is for them to not
support SSD. Idiots...

## Why not C?

I dont like the C build system.
